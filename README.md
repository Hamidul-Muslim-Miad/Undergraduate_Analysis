## 🛠 Methodology & Philosophy
Unlike standard textbooks that often rely on "mathematical maturity" to skip steps, this repository adheres to a **Zero-Gap** policy:

1. **First-Principles Construction**: Every theorem is built from previously established axioms or lemmas. 
2. **No Skipped Algebra**: We avoid phrases like "it is trivial to see" or "it can be shown." Every logical transition is explicit.
3. **Inductive Motivation**: Concepts are introduced only when the limitations of prior logic necessitate them (e.g., the construction of $\mathbb{R}$ is motivated by the incompleteness of $\mathbb{Q}$).
4. **LuaLaTeX Precision**: Compiled using LuaLaTeX for superior memory management and modern font handling.
