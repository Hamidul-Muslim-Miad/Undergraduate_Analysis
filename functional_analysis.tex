\begin{Definition}{Normed Vector Space}\label{normed_vector_space}
  A normed vector space is defined as a vector space $V$ over the field $K$ that is equipped with a norm, $\| \cdot \|:V\to\mathbb{R}$, such that the following properties hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Non-negativity: For all $x\in V,\ ||x||\geq 0$.
    \item Positive Definiteness: For every $x\in V,\ ||x||=0$ if and only if $x$ is the zero vector.
    \item Absolute Homogeneity: For $\lambda\in K,\ x\in V,\ ||\lambda x||=|\lambda| ||x||$.
    \item Triangle Inequality: For all $x,y\in V$, $||x+y||\leq||x||+||y||$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Definition}
\begin{Definition}{Topological Vector Space}\label{topological_vector_space}
  A topological vector space $V$ is defined to be a vector space $V$ over a topological field $K$ (Generally $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ equipped with the standard topology), and is endowed with a topology such that the following operations are continuous:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Vector Addition, $+: V\cross V\to V$.
    \item Scalar Multiplication, $\cdot: K\cross V\to V$.
  \end{enumerate}
  The domain associated with these operations are the product topology.
\end{Definition}
\begin{Theorem}{Relation between Normed and Topological Vector Spaces}\label{relation_between_normed_and_topological_vector_spaces}
  Every normed vector space is a topological vector space.
\end{Theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $V$ be a normed vector space.
\end{proof}
\begin{Definition}{Banach Space}\label{banach_space}
  A complete normed space is defined as a Banach space.
\end{Definition}
